# AnarchyConnect is shutting down and it will be rebranded in future
## ViaProxyConnect
ViaProxyConnect Should Be Used as 
`address_port_version.viaproxy.anarchyconnect.duckdns.org:56114`
example:
i am going to lenni0451 and RaphiMC's ViaProxyConnect server, so i use:
`viaproxy.raphimc.net_25565_1.20.4.viaproxy.anarchyconnect.duckdns.org:56114`
## VIAaaSConnect(Likely DEFUNCT)
Should Be Used as 
`address._pport._vversion._uusername.viaversionasaservice.2002-904e-0812-ffff-0064-ff9b-144.76.8.18.sslip.io:25377`
