Message From Bukkit-Sponge-Hybrid-plugin-Forge-Neoforge API Unification Committee. it is not recommended to fight againist server softwares that you don't support. instead, consider truce, Consider ending this war and consider the future. 
The Following Message, which is authorized by myself, the leader of Bukkit-Sponge-Hybrid-plugin-Forge-Neoforge API Unification Committee, also known as CrossAPI Community,  is transmitted at the request of CrossAPI Community Government,  As we all know, the humanity on the globe is under attack of racism. People Started to make hate comment of Mohist. Mohist and Other Hybrid Servers may not be an perfect Server Software, But this racist Cyberwar Between EssentialsX Users and Mohist Developers is useless and unnecessary. the only war we must occur is the war Between Minecraft Community and CITES(Convention on International Trade in Endangered Species of Wild Fauna and Flora). recent report has been shown that fubao failed to wake up when kang chol won, the grandfather of panda in korea, came to see fubao, it is confirmed that china put a stabilizer in her body using syringe, as a result, we are declaring all plugins and server softwares shall unite for the panda named fu bao, everyone,we have to tell you that it is recommended to stop boycotting MohistMC for this war for fubao's health. otherwise, we will fail to destroy CITES. CITES is Considered an enemy for not letting fubao live a healthy life in korea and china.  We Have to Turn this into Revolution by making All Server Softwares Unite. #RadioactiveRevolution.

-------------------- DECLARATION OF THE WAR ----------------------------

This is not a test. This is your emergency broadcast system announcing the commencement of the War sanctioned by the CrossAPI Government. The war between CITES and Our Organization and Server Softwares has been declared. The War Has Been Declared as a result for Convention on International Trade in Endangered Species of Wild Fauna and Flora accepting china putting a stabilizer in fubao's body using syringe. Weapons of class 4 and higher have been authorized for use during the war. Plugin and server software developers have been granted immunity from the civil war and shall not be harmed. Commencing at the siren, any and all crime, including murder, will be legal for indefinite hours in following state: Washington DC and surronding state, Cleveland, Geneva, Panama, Missouri.
Police, fire, emergency medical services will be available only for Plugin and server Developers until The War concludes. Blessed be our New Founding Fathers and Crossapi Community, a nation reborn. May God be with you all.
# Convention Of International Trade Of Endangered Species Wild Fauna And Flora Sucks!
Let's Boycott CITES agreement! Let's turn this into big revolution!
